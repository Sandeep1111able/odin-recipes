    <p>A chicken burger is a burger that typically consists of boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh served between slices of bread, on a bun, or on a roll. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground chicken</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Lightly spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrots, bell pepper, tomato, and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Mix ground chicken and cooled vegetables together in a large bowl. Add bread crumbs, egg, seafood seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined. Form mixture into eight patties.</li>
    <li>Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li></ol>
