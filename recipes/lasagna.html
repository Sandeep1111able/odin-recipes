    <p>Lasagna also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets.  </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef, (15-20% fat content)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry red wine, or beef broth</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>24 oz Marinara Sauce , (3 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, ground</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp granulated sugars</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat oven to 375˚F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles. Cook until al dente according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9X13 casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Spoon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce. 

    </li>
    <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles:
        Add 3 noodles, 1/3 meat sauce, 1 cup mozarella cheese, 1/2 cheese sauce
        Add 3 noodles, remaining 1/3 meat sauce, remaining 1 cup mozarella. </li>
    <li>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foil from sticking to the cheese). Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes. </li>
    <li>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden. Let lasagna rest 30 min before slicing. 

    </li>

</ol>
